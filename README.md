## 1. TEAM
### a) Members
* Nihar Gopidi \
* Akhila Chitturi
* Akhil Vadlakonda
* Dinesh Reddy Kankanala
* Shashank Patlolla
### b) Communication plan to include project artifact repository, meeting notes, meeting platform, etc.
* Communication Methods: Google chat group is created for day-to-day conversation and syncing. Email for a more formal and documented way of communication.
* Response times for communication: The team members communicate with each other and response time of each member is as minimum as possible. If any team member is absent or away from work place it is informed in the group communication network.
* Attendance in Meeting: We have made few fixed timings which is comfortable for everyone and made it mandatory for everyone to attend, but if informed earlier exemption can be granted. we also have made few optional meetings this means that it is not mandatory for all team members to attend every meeting but at least 3 out of 5 members need to be present. The ones not attending shall inform the rest well in advance. It is appreciated if all can attend anyways.
* Publish control: All changes made by the team members are pushed to the artifact by raising pull requests which are reviewed by the peers before merging.
* Team work and work Division: Work is divided between the team members in the form modules. If anyone faces an issue in the work it will be discussed and come to a deterministic understanding. Any overload can be brought to the notice of the other members so it can be divided or redistributed.ï€
